JioSaavn is the first platform to create this kind of personalised connection between artists and their wider fan base. By collaborating with these artists, JioSaavn hopes to facilitate deeper engagement with their target audience through their preferred medium – music. JioSaavn is maximizing the reach of the “Made By” brand campaign through cross-channel linkages, including in-app programming, house ads, Google Ads, and a Facebook collaboration. YouTube videos have already launched featuring artist-curators, along with artist trivia posts, Instagram Story ads, and Twitter amplification. The platform has conducted a Facebook Live video with rapper Badshah and deployed ‘Listen Now’ ads across all top digital channels.
